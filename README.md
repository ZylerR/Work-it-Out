Created a workout app for my Mobile Application Development class. This app allows you to create and perform a list of workouts using an SQLite Database. You can add, remove, or edit the workout items on the list by choosing the edit option. Once you've made a list that you like, you can go back to the main menu and choose "Do a Workout." to perform a workout. Any item you remove from the list in this window will not affect the stored list in the SQLite database.
